# Assembler
Assembler to convert from Assembly code to ISA that you can find it [here](https://github.com/SamyBahaa/-Designing-and-implementing-a-simple-5-stage-pipelined-processor/blob/master/README.md)
you can also find the source code of the assembler in the sourceCode branch in this repository

## How to use the assembler
### 1) 
After downloading the [Assembler](https://github.com/SamyBahaa/Assembler.git) and follow the screen instruction for the setup. when it finished you will find the app icon appear on the desktop like this.

### 2)
Open the Assembler and it shoud look like this after the splash screen is over

### 3)
Click on browse and choose the the file that containe your assembly code if it was .asm or .txt

### 4)
Once you choose your file that containe your assembly code click on complie and if every thing went well this window should appear

### 5) 
The output of the assembler is 2 mem file that you will need to initialize the instruction memory and data memory of the processor. We have to separate file because we implement our processor using harvard architecture which have to separate memory one for data and other for instructions. It should look like this.
